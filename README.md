# Document Chatbot with AI-Powered Querying

## Project Name: **DocuQuery AI**

### Description
DocuQuery AI is an intelligent document processing and query-response system that allows users to upload scanned PDFs, extract text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and ask questions based on the extracted text. The system uses:
- **Tesseract.js** for OCR
- **Google Gemini AI** for text-based Q&A
- **Express.js** for the backend API
- **React.js** for the frontend

This project enables users to interact with their documents dynamically, making information retrieval seamless and efficient.
